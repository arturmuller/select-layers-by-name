Select Layers by Name
=====================

Create a selection using layer names. The plugin has two commands:

**Select Layers by Exact Name** (⌘L) selects all layers whose name _matches exactly_ the name you have typed. For example, to select a layer called 'New Post' you should type 'New Post' — using only 'New' or 'Post' won't select the layer.

**Select Layers by Partial Name** (⎇⌘L) selects all layers whose name _contains_ the name you have typed. For example, to select a layer called 'New Post' you will get a match by typing 'New', 'Post', 'ew', 'ost', etc...

Note that both commands are scoped to the _current page_ and are _case insensitive_.
