Select Layers by Name
=====================

Create a selection using layer names. The plugin has two commands, both of which are case insensitive:

**Select Layers by Exact Name (⌘L)** matches all layers on current page whose name _matches exactly_ the name you have typed. For example, to select a layer called 'New Post' you are able to type 'new post' or 'NeW PoSt' but using only 'New' or 'Post' won't work.

**Select Layers by Partial Name (⎇⌘L)** matches all layers on current page whose name _contains_ the name you have typed. For example, to select a layer called 'New Post' you are able to type 'new' or 'POST' to make the selection.
