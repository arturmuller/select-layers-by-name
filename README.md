**BEWARE: This plugin is written in legacy Sketch plugin format and it will not work on new versions of Sketch. I will rewrite this once I have a spare second, so check back later if you're interested in this functionality. (PRs welcome!)**

# Select Layers by Name

Create a selection using layer names. The plugin has two commands:

**Match Exact Name** (⌘/) selects all layers whose name _matches exactly_ the text you have typed. For example, to select a layer called 'New Post' you should type 'New Post' — using only 'New' or 'Post' won't select the layer.

**Match Partial Name** (⎇⌘/) selects all layers whose name _contains_ the text you have typed. For example, to select a layer called 'New Post' you will get a match by typing 'New', 'Post', 'ew', 'ost', etc...

Note that both commands are scoped to the _current page_ and are _case insensitive_.
